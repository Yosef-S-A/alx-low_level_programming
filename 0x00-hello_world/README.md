B# C - Hello, World
In this project I learned the compilation steps of C programminng language. I also learned text-printing in C and using ```gcc```.

+ A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

:one: [Compiler](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
+ A script that compiles a C file but does not link saves it to a file with an extension ```.O```.

:two: [Assembler](https://github.com/Yosef-S-A/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
+ A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
