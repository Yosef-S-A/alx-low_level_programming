# 0x1E-search_algorithms

In this project, I worked on search algorithms. I implemented various types of search algorithms and stated the corresponding space/time complexities for each.

## Tasks :clipboard:

### 0. [Linear search]()
   
	+ C function that searches for a value in an array of integers using linear search.

### 1. [Binary search]()
   
	+ C function that searches fro a value in a sorted array of integers using binary search.

### 2. [Big O #0]()

       	+ Text file containing the worst case time complexity of linear search.

### 3. [Big O #1]()

        + Text file containing the worst case time complexity of binary search.
